Being depressed is like being wrong all the time 

(At least, I’m pretty sure, lol).

Okay like yesterday I was wearing a t-shirt and a beanie. That’s just… Not right. 

“Nice try!” You know what I mean? “Come again, good sir.” 

Like: Choose a lane! You can’t be chilly on your head and not all the other places. Wear a hoodie. Be coherent. 

We're constantly guessing. Someone smiles. You’re like: they’re probably happy. But you also know that’s not necessarily true. Because if you’re feeling depressed - or if you’re feeling depressed enough to believe that you *could* be depressed - then it’s like: I’m not gonna broadcast all my shit out there. That’d be bad. Annoying. A downer! A reason for concern and maybe even intervention! So instead of doing what’s normal: 

Happy —---------------------> :) 

Sad —---------------------> :(  

You’re all like: 

<div style="width:100%;height:0;padding-bottom:75%;position:relative;"><iframe src="/assets/pickle.svg" width="100%" height="100%" style="position:absolute" frameBorder="0" class="giphy-embed" allowFullScreen></iframe></div>

Because there’s no way I’m going to make an: “I’m feeling insane” face when I'm feeling insane. That would be sorta “uh-oh” you know what I mean. Like you probably wouldn’t get lunch with me is what I’m saying. 

So for me, sometimes I’m all:

but instead of being like:

I’m like trying to be more like

or

but I feel like it really comes out more like:

Like all weird and disjointed and stuff. 

And so when someone is like: What’s up, man? Sometimes I can be like, *ohhh this guy. Classic. He’s probably feeling ~insane~ right now. Because "sup"? Are you kidding me? That’s ~inssaaanneneneneeeee~. I can read you, buddy, okay? I got you. You’re going craaaazzzy. It’s all good, I see you.*


<div style="width:100%"><div style="height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;position:relative;width:100%"><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameBorder="0" height="100%" src="https://giphy.com/embed/HLhyFmRNkMdqshyOIw/video" style="left:0;position:absolute;top:0" width="100%"></iframe></div></div>


 
And of course they’re like *what’re you talking about.* They're like: *I’m all good,* (but they’re clearly not good.)

What I’m really trying to say is this: I think part of depression is feeling like you can’t tell what’s good or bad. Worse than that, you’re actually sure it *is* bad, but you also know you have a track record of thinking things are bad when they’re not. 

Someone says something, you interpret. But whatever is doing the interpreting is off. It's not the content, it's the filter. Something comes in, and whatever comes out - no matter what - it doesnt' look great.
