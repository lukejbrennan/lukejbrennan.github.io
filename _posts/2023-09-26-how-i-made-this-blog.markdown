Hello world, this is **markdown**.

This is how I made this blog...

https://pages.github.com/#project-site 
https://github.com/roshan0708/portfolio_v2/blob/master/src/App.js 
http://jekyllrb.com/docs/ 
https://karpathy.github.io/2014/07/01/switching-to-jekyll/ 


basic blog… https://github.com/roshan0708/portfolio_v2/blob/master/src/App.js 

to see the basic version of the blog, you can run jekyll serve --watch

... or you could do 

bundle exec jekyll serve that's the real one
