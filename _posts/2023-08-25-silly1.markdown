The end of a long, long war where one country was all up in another country's business trying to "help them out" and "give them a helping hand" and also maybe "get some of that oil." Like one country was occupying another country out of a genuine desire to promote peace and at the same time get all that good, good oil at a fair (but cheap!) price. Anyway the whole flyover thing would be a celebration of the end of the (helpful!) occupation but also - let's be honest - a little bit of a threat that like, we have a lot of jets, and if you were thinking about hiking up the price of oil, let's just maybe keep it at that cheap, cheap rate for a wee bit longer. Because we're nice but, like, not that nice.
