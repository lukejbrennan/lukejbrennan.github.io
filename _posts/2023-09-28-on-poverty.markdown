The pants at Target are pretty nice. They’re lulu knockoffs, and I’d just bought my lulu not-knockoffs. As in original lulu material and yeah, so what, I was looking at the target brand to see if I wanted to buy some of those, too, because it’s nice sometimes to have a second pair that you like. That you won’t be heartbroken over if they get a little dirty. 

I was in the pants section and a man came up to me with bags behind him holding a pair of sunglasses.

“Hey man don’t want to interrupt - know you’re buying pants, wish I could buy some pants, but” he was wondering if I could buy him some sunglasses. It all came out low and fast, and I was surprised how much he managed to say in an instant.

Sure, I said, but maybe a little too easily because he asked if I could also buy him some shorts. 

“Nah that’s okay that’s okay” he said, walking towards the cash register. 

He’d barely given me time to think about it. He caught me on the way down: I was going to hesitate, but he caught me before. 

And I was actively trying not to pause - like when someone asks: “You sure you don’t want me to come?” And you don’t. But you don’t want to tell them that - not yet - that, just this time!, you’d be better off without them. 

But it’s a quickdraw and you lost, having not that many quickdraws under you belt, and they say: “No that’s fine” before you say something easy and safe:  “I know you’re busy,” “I’m sure I’ll manage” as if you hadn’t really been thinking about the fact that they’d go with you so much as the fact that they have other things that they ought to be doing with their day. 

Knowing still, that there is nothing they’d like more than to come along with you, and while you wish you could grant them the affirmation that, yes, you would like them to come along, you really don’t want that, so you pause a second, deciphering, decline without hurt but the tick of a half-second is too long, and though you WOULD have them come along, you end up wounding them instead - microscopically, but also completely. Like tapping a mirror that fragments with a million hairline fractures, barely visible.

And although it’s just a moment, and it doesn’t mean much, you’re really saying, in the end: “I’m just fine without you, and I don’t need you to always come along with me. It’s time to grow up. I can do this on my own.” Not realizing that you will have loads of time where you are on your own; that sometimes, even when you are with people or around people – and not just strangers: we’re talking people at large, yes, but also YOUR people (people you know and love) – even when you are with them, you may still find yourself to be, at times, on your own. 

“What’d you think,” he said, as he put the sunglasses  on. I shrugged - hopefully, like: Well yeah, if you like them, I like them, and we checked his reflection in the mirror on the back of the dressing room door. 

Except the mirror was super small, just a little hexagon, so I squeezed in behind him to get a better look. He bobbed his head, left and right, deciding. I said: “Yeah” and he said, “Yeah okay” then, “Thanks again man.” 

At the self-checkout, he mentioned something about bedding. I looked down at his other bags: full of bedding and other - let’s just call them what they are - necessities. Something to sleep on, a pillow, a pair of socks, and a t-shirt. 

I think he was giving me the option to pay for them: No pressure, but I AM going to steal this if you don’t pay for it. I won’t make you, you can pay for this if you want. I glided on by, pretended I didn’t see. None of my business, after all, all the things that you carry. 

Back to the screen: sunglasses, $20. Jesus. Credit card. No receipt. Maybe it’d be helpful to have a receipt. Receipt. Yes, printed. 

I held the sunglasses as he grabbed a new target bag. All of his other bags were also target bags (man of the details, nice). He accepted the sunglasses: two hands holding his get out of jail free card. I dropped them in the bag and he walked out of the store. No problemo. 

I continued shopping for lulu knockoffs and wondered, vaguely, if I had just helped this man steal some bedding, and I’m sure Target can handle the load, but would someone talk to me about it? 

“Hey, don’t... buy people stuff in store, okay?” 

What could they even say: “That’s a homeless man.” 

“We really shouldn’t have him soliciting in-store.”

What a lousy word, Soliciting. A cover word, all posh, and none of the way see through. You’re saying you can’t have a person ask for things here, right? You’re saying there’s no begging in the store.

“Target - no begging! We hardly allow asking nicely, and even then, if you’re being a little needy about it, well, that’s soliciting, and we really don’t want you to be doing that because - yes, we HAVE had problems in the past.” 

Problems in the past, but it’s me and my mom on vacation, and we’ve just got to Chicago, and it’s my first time. I don’t know why we’re here, really, but I’m happy to come along because Chicago is a New Place and I’ll get to see the lake and more importantly, I’ll get to miss a day or two of school and a three day weekend is so much better than a two day - especially when the two day routine is so predictable with homework, grass cutting and baseball.

So hell yeah I’ll come with you -- and since you know it’s only sort of entertaining for me to be along for a work trip, you think about it when I am BEGGING you to get some pop tarts at Target.

You are on the verge of saying oh what the heck but you want to double check the damage that 200g of sugar (or whatever it is) would do to an antsy 8 year old. But let’s face it, the pop tarts would also be partly for you, and hell yeah that sounds nice. 

So you grab the Double Chocolate Fudge, and we pass by the lulu-not-lulu-pants section and walk out of the store, where there is someone on the ground who is not moving. We stop walking and look at each other before you bend down to talk to him, but still, he’s really not moving, and he smells like alcohol and sweat, but I don’t know that yet - just that he smells like something. And you call 911 - not to report him or anything crazy like that - but just to make sure that’s he’s a-okay because we’ve really got to get going and well, he doesn’t look like he’s doing too good.
