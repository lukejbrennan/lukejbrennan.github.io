I'm writing this blog and watching it update live on my blog page. For reference, I'm writing on a little wee vs code editor. It's sort of strange to see a blog post start to take form with all of the files necessary for running the blog itself all in the same place! Yay! See [This post on Jekyll](https://lukejbrennan.github.io/2014/07/02/how-i-made-this-blog.html) to read more about settup...

Anyway, really for this blog post, I just want to make a list of all the different ways I want to use this blog. 


Here are some of the categories I could write about:
- 30-Day challenges
- Productivity and Chill
- Entrepreneurship
- Filling the Void
- Worrying Less
- Experiments...
- Mini-retirements...
- Recipes - why not!
- Travel
- Writing and Blogging
- Fiction
- Goofy
- On The Importance of Money (aka on Homelessness, poverty, etc)
- Delights!
- On Kindness
- Journaling
- Failure Journal
- Dreamlining, Budget, and BHAG
- Reviews (products, foods, etc)
- Yearly Reviews
- Standup Journal


... that's a lot! and this blog should allow for comments! If you have any suggestions, I'm all ears! Comment below ðŸ˜¬
