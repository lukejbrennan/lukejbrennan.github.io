Everyone wants a little more info on how to accomplish more. Which comes out of what? That means that everyone's like: 

"Hey you, I want you to get a little bit more done."

What a shame! What a bummer. Who's the ruler-guy. Why do you have a ruler? Stop carrying around that ruler, dude. 

For real. It's *weird*. It's weird that literally every time I look at you, you're like *what's upppp* and you're holding onto a ruler. Like your rapping that ruler against your leg or something. Dude - be less *weird*, dude.

No for real, though. It's awesome that everyone is so fast-forward and forward-thinking and so "I want to get better better better." 

But at the end of the day, it'd be nice to be like: "Hell yeah." You know? Like, you did it. Like fallen on the field of battle: exhausted… proud… -  all that. 

Isn't that the dream? At the end of the day, you take off your socks (or whatever - cook up a pot of tea), and you plod out onto your deck with your bare feet, and your tea, and your black lab, and you look out over the fields of work with that perfect mix of: "yes… tomorrow" and "wow… today I achieved so much." 

I feel like we're always trying to do more, be better, get more done. Ah - but we're doing great! Today - just for today… tomorrow you can go back to being the person with the ruler and the "no no no" and the "what if you had 10 days in one day…!" and the "the ideal morning routine is the one where you just get to work" kinda swag - just for today, be content with where you're at and what you're doing. 

Because I'll take a bet, and I'm not good at betting, but I'll bet anyway. I'll bet you're trying, and that's, like, cool.
