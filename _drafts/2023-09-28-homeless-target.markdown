Passive aggressive street lamp
Yo what’s up

He’s like i know you’re trying to buy some pants
I’d like to buy those too but I was wondering if you could help me with some sunglasses
We both looked at his sunglasses
What’d you think
I was wondering if you could also get me some shorts
Nah that’s okay that’s okay
Caught on to my less than a second hesitation

You sure you don’t want me to come?
No I get it I get it
All good!
Just hurt
Undoable
Microscopic but swallowing
Sitting on the sidewalk
Living on the sidewalk

The pants at target are pretty nice. They’re lulu knockoffs, and I’d just bought my lulu not-knockoffs. As in original lulu material and yeah, so what, I was looking at the target brand to see, well, if I wanted to buy some of those.

Which is when someone came up to me, carrying bags. Lugging bags, and managing to produce a set of sunglasses. “Hey man don’t want to interrupt - know you’re buying pants, wish I could buy some pants, too but” he was wondering if I could buy him some sunglasses. It all came out fast and low and I was surprised at how quickly he said so many words. 

Sure, I said, but maybe a little too easily, because he asked if I could also buy him some shorts. 
Nah that’s okay that’s okay. Barely giving me a second to hesitate. He caught me on the way down: I was going to hesitate, but he said that too fast. I feel like I hadn’t paused yet. 

It was the kind of hesitation when someone asks you: “You sure you don’t want me to come?” And you don’t. But you don’t want to tell then, not yet, that you’d be better off without them, just in this circumstance. 

But it’s a quickdraw and you lost it, and they say: “No that’s fine” before you say, something easy and safe: “I know you’re busy” “I’m sure I’ll manage” as if you hadn’t really been thinking about the fact that they’d go with you so much as the fact that they have other things that they ought to be doing with their day. Knowing all the same, that there is nothing they’d like to do with their day more than come along with you, and, while you wish you could grant them the affirmation that you’d like them to come along, you really wouldn’t, so you pause a second, deciphering: “How to decline without hurt” but the tick of a half second is too long, and though you would have them come along, you end up wounding them instead - microscopically, but also, in a way sort of existentially. Because though it’s just a moment and it doesn’t mean much, you’re really saying, in the end: “I’m just fine without you, and I don’t need you to always come along with me. It’s time I grow up. I can do this on my own.” 

Not realizing, that you will be on your own and from now on and from now on you will have exponentially less time with them, your parents. 

“What’d you think,” he said, as he put the sunglasses  on. And I shrugged - hopefully, I mean, like: “Well yeah, if you like them, I like them” and we checked his reflection in the mirror on the back of the dressing room door. 

Except, the mirror was super small, a little hectagon, so I squeezed in behind him to get a better look, through the mirror, so as to share some sort of experience with this guy, also looking through the mirror. Because we could both look at him through the mirror, and I only I could look at him just regular. It felt like joining in, in a good way. 
He bobbed his head, left and right, deciding. And I said: “Yeah” and he said, “yeah okay” then “thanks so much man.” 

And we went to the checkout, which was fine, except the sunglasses were for some reason $20 and not just becuase of that, but also becuase he mentioned something about bedding, and I looked down his other bags and they were full of other - let’s just call them - necessessities: mostly things to sleep on, and a pair of socks, and a t-shirt. 

I had the moment to pay for them I think. That’s what he was offering: I won’t make you, but if you want, you can pay for this. But I glidded on by, and preteneded I wasn’t looking at those bags. None of my business, after all, all the things that you carry. 

I turned my attention back to the screen. Sunglasses, $20. Chose credit card. No receipt. No. Maybe it’d be helpful to have a receipt. Receipt. Printed. 
The receipt printed, and I help the sunglasses as the man with me grabbed another target bag - a new one. All of his other bags were also target bags (a man of the details, nice). He held the new target bag, two hands open, and received the sunglasses into that new bag and walked out the store. 

And I continued shopping for lulu knock offs and wondered, vaguely, if I had just helped this man steal some bedding, and I’m sure Target can handle the load, but would someone talk to me? “Hey, don’t... buy people stuff in store, okay?” What would they say: “That’s a homeless man” 
“We really shouldn’t have him soliciting in store.”
What a lousy way to say that. Soliciting. A cover word. Posh and opaque. You’re saying you can’t have a person ask for things here? You’re saying there’s no begging in the store? Imagine if that were a rule. 
Target - no begging!
And it’s me and my mom on vacation and we’ve just got to Chicago and it’s my first time and I don’t know why we’re here, really, but I’m happy to come along because Chicago is NEW and I’ll get to see the LAKE and more importantly, I’ll get to miss a day or two of school and a three day weekend is always so much better than a two day - especially when that two day is as routine as they’ve come to be: homework, cut the grass, baseball, homework then Sunday mass, panera, homework, homework. 

So hell yeah I’ll come with you, and you know it’s only sort of entertaining for me to be along with you, so when I am BEGGING you to get some poptarts so that we can add a little spice to our semi-vacationing lives, you are inclined to say “Oh what the heck” and you pause and think it over: weighing the sugar content for my health and also what consequences you might endure if you sugared me up at 9am on Saturday, but also, let’s face it, kind of wanting to get some chocolate fudge brownie something something for you
