Target Pants, Ethics, Poptarts, and The Sunglasses Guy

The pants at target are pretty nice. They’re lulu knockoffs, and I’d just bought my lulu not-knockoffs. As in original lulu material and yeah, so what, I was looking at the target brand to see, well, if I wanted to buy some of those, too, because it’s nice sometimes to have a second pair that you like that you won’t be heartbroken over if they get a little dirty. 

I was in the pants section when a man came up to me, lugging bags behind him and holding a pair of sunglasses.

“Hey man don’t want to interrupt - know you’re buying pants, wish I could buy some pants, but” he was wondering if I could buy him some sunglasses. It all came out low and fast, and I was surprised how much he managed to say in an instant.

Sure, I said, but maybe a little too easily (?) because he asked if I could also buy him some shorts. 

“Nah that’s okay that’s okay” he said, walking towards the cash register. 

He’d barely given me time to think about it. He caught me on the way down: I was going to hesitate, but he caught me before I could. 

And I was actively trying not to pause - like when someone asks: “You sure you don’t want me to come?” And you don’t. But you don’t want to tell them - not yet - that, just this time!, you’d be better off without them.

But it’s a quickdraw and you lost, having not that many quickdraws under you belt, and they say: “No that’s fine” before you say something easy and safe: “I know you’re busy,” “I’m sure I’ll manage” as if you hadn’t really been thinking about the fact that they’d go with you so much as the fact that they have other things that they ought to be doing with their day. 

Knowing, still, that there is nothing they’d like to do with their day more than come along with you, and, while you wish you could grant them the affirmation 

that, yes, you would like them to come along, you really don’t want that, so you pause a second, deciphering: “decline without hurt” but the tick of a half second is too long, and though you WOULD have them come along, you end up wounding them instead - microscopically, but also, in way, completely. Like tapping a mirror that fragments with a million hairline fractures, barely visible.

And although it’s just a moment, and it doesn’t mean much, you’re really saying, in the end: “I’m just fine without you, and I don’t need you to always come along with me. It’s time I grow up. I can do this on my own.” Not realizing, that you will be on your own and from now on and from now on you will have exponentially less time with them. 

“What’d you think,” he said, as he put the sunglasses  on. And I shrugged - hopefully, like: Well yeah, if you like them, I like them, and we checked his reflection in the mirror on the back of the dressing room door. 

Except the mirror was super small, just a little hectagon, so I squeezed in behind him to get a better look through the mirror. He bobbed his head, left and right, deciding. And I said: “Yeah” and he said, “Yeah okay” then “Thanks again man.” 

We went to the checkout, which was fine, except the sunglasses were for some reason $20 and not just because of that, but also because as we were checking out he mentioned something about bedding, and as I looked down at his other bags, I could see that they were full of bedding and other - let’s just call them - necessessities: mostly things to sleep on, and a pair of socks, and a t-shirt. 

I had the moment to pay for them I think. That’s what he was offering: I won’t make you, but if you want, you can pay for this. But I glided on by, pretended I didn’t see. None of my business, after all, all the things that you carry. 

Back to the screen. Sunglasses, $20. Chose credit card. No receipt. No. Maybe it’d be helpful to have a receipt. Receipt. Printed. 

The receipt printed, and I help the sunglasses as the man with me grabbed another target bag - a new one. All of his other bags were also target bags (a man of the details, nice). He held the new target bag, two hands open, and received the sunglasses into that new bag and walked out the store. 

And I continued shopping for lulu knock offs and wondered, vaguely, if I had just helped this man steal some bedding, and I’m sure Target can handle the load, but would someone talk to me? 

“Hey, don’t... buy people stuff in store, okay?” What would they say: “That’s a homeless man” 

“We really shouldn’t have him soliciting in store.”

What a lousy way to say that. Soliciting. A cover word, all posh, and none of the way see through. You’re saying you can’t have a person ask for things here, right? You’re saying there’s no begging in the store? 

Target - no begging! We hardly allow asking nicely, and if you are persistent, well, that’s soliciting and we really don’t want you to be doing that because - oh well, yes- we have had problems in the past. 

And it’s me and my mom on vacation, and we’ve just got to Chicago, and it’s my first time, and I don’t know why we’re here, really, but I’m happy to come along because Chicago is NEW and I’ll get to see the LAKE and more importantly, I’ll get to miss a day or two of school and a three day weekend is always so much better than a two day - especially when that two day is as routine as they’ve come to be: homework and grass cutting and baseball on Saturday and Sunday with mass, Panera, and homework, homework, homework. 

So hell yeah I’ll come with you, and you know it’s only sort of entertaining for me to be along with you, so when I am BEGGING you to get some poptarts so that we can add a little spice to our semi-vacation semi-work trip, you are inclined to say Oh what the heck and you pause to think it over: sugar content and a cracked up Saturday but also 

for my health and also what consequences you might endure if you sugared me up at 9am on Saturday, but also, let’s face it, kind of wanting to get some chocolate fudge brownie something something for you
