New stuff that you don’t always - plan, you know what i mean?
like some of it, is the same, but then other things are gonna
come out of nowhere, sort of

At the end of the day, they could like

THAT’S THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO DESCRIBE
WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT.

DO YOU HAVE FURNITURE?

what i’m saying is: get his ass
with kindness

no matter what comes. 
a little bit
be like: yes
because it’s coming
from something else
which is guiding you



This being human is a guest house.
Every morning a new arrival.

A joy, a depression, a meanness,
some momentary awareness comes
as an unexpected visitor.

Welcome and entertain them all!
Even if they’re a crowd of sorrows,
who violently sweep your house
empty of its furniture,
still, treat each guest honorably.
He may be clearing you out
for some new delight.

The dark thought, the shame, the malice,
meet them at the door laughing,
and invite them in.

Be grateful for whoever comes,
because each has been sent
as a guide from beyond.
