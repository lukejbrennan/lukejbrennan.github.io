11 Rules for Business

I'm going to fire myself after 2 weeks if I'm not making money as a freelance writer

I'm going to pitch 8x a day in order to try to not get fired

I'm going to remember that my main goal is not to be a freelance writer but a comedian

I commit to being a comedian for 12 months

I commit to working on that for 2hrs a day minimum

I commit to working my buns off to get the skills/experience in order to make money for this product

I acknowledge that 

I will STOP spending more than I make

I will combine social activities with eating or working out to maximize freetime

I will cut down on scrolling on instagram (merp how? by downloading clearspace! and choosing instagram as my app)

I will sell my TV and give up watching netflix (unless it's a date)
Not consume content without actively asking "How will this help me run my business?" (Reading for pleasure counts…! Netflix for articles, counts!)

Join a community of comedians, formally or non-formally. You need to have a "tribe" that you want to belong to. 

STOP: redirecting. I'm the kind of person that really can get into things! I might think I want to be a lawyer after watching A Few Good Men, for example. Stop redirecting, by stop watching inspiring content/listening to inspiring experts in the field that are NOT in your chosen field.

I'll check email 2x a day!
